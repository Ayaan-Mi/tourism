        <h2>Chandigarh - The Beautiful City</h2>
        <h3>Chandigarh, the capital city of both Punjab and Haryana, is often referred to as "The Beautiful City." Known
            for its modern architecture and abundant greenery, Chandigarh is India's first planned city
            post-independence, designed by the Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier. The city's layout features wide
            boulevards, neatly organized sectors, and a harmonious balance between urban and natural elements. The
            Capitol Complex, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is a testament to Le Corbusier's modernist vision, with its
            impressive buildings like the High Court, Secretariat, and Legislative Assembly, all designed with striking
            concrete forms and spacious plazas.<br><br><br>

            Chandigarh offers a range of attractions that appeal to various interests. Sukhna Lake, a man-made
            reservoir, is a popular spot for boating, jogging, and enjoying scenic views. The Bird Park nearby is home
            to a diverse array of bird species, providing a tranquil escape for nature lovers. The Rock Garden, created
            by Nek Chand, is a unique artistic marvel, featuring sculptures made from recycled materials. Rose Garden,
            Asia's largest, showcases thousands of rose varieties and hosts the annual Rose Festival.<br><br><br>

            For shopping and entertainment, Sector-17 is the city's bustling commercial hub, while Elante Mall is among
            the largest shopping malls in Northern India. Art enthusiasts can explore the Government Museum and Art
            Gallery, which houses a vast collection of Gandharan sculptures, Pahari miniatures, and contemporary Indian
            art. Together, these attractions highlight the diverse experiences that make Chandigarh a captivating
            destination for tourists.</h3>
