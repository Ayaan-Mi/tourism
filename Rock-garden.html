                    The Rock Garden of Chandigarh, also known as Nek Chand Saini's Rock Garden of Nathupur, is a unique
                    sculpture garden in Chandigarh, India. Spanning 40 acres, it was secretly created by Nek Chand
                    Saini, a
                    government official, starting in 1957 during his spare time. The garden is renowned for its
                    sculptures
                    and installations made entirely from industrial waste, household discards, and other repurposed
                    materials. What began as a hidden project eventually grew into a celebrated landmark, showcasing Nek
                    Chand's creativity and the beauty that can emerge from recycling and reclaiming waste.
